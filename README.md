# Coding Practice for Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp

## Purpose
This is a repository strictly for sharing my coding practice during the Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp.

## How to navigate
Folder structure is broken up into months, then by days.

Particularly for front end practice, you will likely have to download or copy the code and load it up in a browser. Double check the link pathing if there's any issues.

Readmes are sometimes provided if I'm specifically trying to figure out some function or element.
