# Wireframe Practice

The purpose of a wireframe is to allow the coder to define the information hierarchy of the HTML that you are working on, but more importantly lays out how elements may be laid out in one another.

Wireframing should be done outside of code so that the coder may have a better understanding of the structural hierarchies that they have to build in their HTML.

The <a href="https://github.com/inknsharps/coding_practice/tree/main/02_feb_2021/02_04_21/holy_grail_flexbox">holy grail layout that was built here</a> is such an example of where wireframing would be important, because there are multiple solutions to setting up this layout, especially as over time more and more features get added to browsers.
